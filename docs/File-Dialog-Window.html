<p><a name="index-file-dialog-window-11"></a>
<a name="index-file-dialog-window-12"></a>The <dfn>file dialog window</dfn> is available to help the user view and select
which file they would like to view.  It provides the user with a list of all
the files that make up the program being debugged.  If there are no files
available, because there is no program being debugged or because there is
no debug symbols, then the file dialog will not open and a message will be
displayed at the status bar.

   <p>You can get to the file dialog by hitting <code>o</code> when you are at the source
window.  Once you enter the file dialog, it is possible to leave it by hitting
<code>q</code>.  You can navigate the file dialog using the standard direction keys
and you can even use regular expression to find your file.  This can save a
lot of time as the number of files grow.

   <p>The full list of commands that are available in the source window is in
<a href="File-Dialog-Mode.html#File-Dialog-Mode">File Dialog Mode</a>.
