<h3 class="section">3.2 Commands available during GDB mode</h3>

<p><a name="index-commands_002c-in-GDB-mode-20"></a>
When in <dfn>GDB mode</dfn>, the user is mostly interested in working with the GDB
console.  That is, sending commands to GDB and receiving data back from GDB. 
Almost all data passed into this window is directly sent to readline and then
to GDB.

   <p>It is important to understand that CGDB parses the keys entered in
the GDB window and has the first chance at dealing with them.  If it is
interested in the keys, it will handle them. Below is a list of keys that
CGDB is interested in, and does not pass along any further.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>cgdbmodekey</kbd><dd>Switch back to source window.  This is defaulted to the &lt;ESC&gt; key.

     <br><dt><kbd>page up</kbd><dd>Move up a page.

     <br><dt><kbd>page down</kbd><dd>Move down a page.

     <br><dt><kbd>F11</kbd><dd>Go to the beginning of the GDB buffer.

     <br><dt><kbd>F12</kbd><dd>Go to the end of the GDB buffer. 
</dl>

   <p>Any other keys, besides the ones above, CGDB is currently not interested in. 
CGDB will pass along these keys to the readline library. When readline has
determined that a command has been received, it alerts CGDB, and a command is
then sent to GDB. This is the same method used when invoking GDB directly.
