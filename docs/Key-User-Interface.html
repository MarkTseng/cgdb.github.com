<h2 class="chapter">6 CGDB key user interface</h2>

<p><a name="index-CGDB-key-user-interface-28"></a>
The Key User Interface is how CGDB receives input from the user.  It is
usually referred to as the <dfn>KUI</dfn>.  CGDB simply asks the KUI for the next
key the user typed and the KUI will provide it.

   <p>The KUI has 2 major responsibilities besides reading normal user input
and providing it to CGDB.  It needs to detect when the user has typed a
user defined map or when the user has hit a special key on the keyboard.

   <p>A user defined map, or simply <dfn>map</dfn>, is used to change the meaning
of typed keys.  Some users may refer to this type of functionality as a
<dfn>macro</dfn>.  An example would be <code>map a b</code>.  If the user then typed
the &lt;a&gt; character, the KUI would detect that it was mapped to &lt;b&gt;
and return &lt;b&gt; to CGDB.

   <p>When the user types a special key on the keyboard, a <dfn>key code</dfn> is
sent to CGDB.  Typically, keys like  <kbd>HOME</kbd>, <kbd>DEL</kbd>, &lt;F1&gt;, etc,
when pressed will send several characters to the application instead of just
one character like a normal key does.  These characters combined are called a
<dfn>key sequence</dfn>.  The KUI is responsible for assembling the key sequences
back together and reporting to CGDB that a particular key was typed by the
user.  The <kbd>ESC</kbd> key is special because typically most key codes start with
that key.  This usually gives all key codes a common first key in its key
sequence.  The KUI uses the terminfo database to determine what key sequences
are sent by which keycodes.  There are a few commonly used key sequences
that are hard coded into CGDB.

   <p>A major challenge the KUI has to overcome is determining when a map or a
key sequence is received.  The KUI sometimes will need to read more than
one character to determine this.  For example, if the user has 2 maps,
<code>map abc def</code> and <code>map abd def</code>, the KUI would have to buffer at
least the characters &lt;a&gt; and &lt;b&gt; before it could determine if the
user was going to type a map.  After the next key press, if the user types
&lt;c&gt; or &lt;d&gt; then a map was received and the KUI will return
<kbd>d e f</kbd> to CGDB.  Otherwise, no map was received and the KUI must return
<kbd>a b</kbd> to CGDB.

   <p>The options <var>timeout</var>, <var>ttimeout</var>, <var>timeoutlen</var> and
<var>ttimeoutlen</var> can be used to tell the KUI if it should timeout on
partial mappings or key sequences, and if so, how long it should wait before
timing out.
