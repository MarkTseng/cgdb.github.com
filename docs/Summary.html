<h2 class="unnumbered">Summary of CGDB</h2>

<p>CGDB is a curses-based interface to the GNU Debugger (GDB).  The goal of CGDB
is to be lightweight and responsive; not encumbered with unnecessary features.

   <p>The interface is designed to deliver the familiar GDB text interface, with a
split screen showing the source as it executes.  The UI is modeled on the
classic Unix text editor, vi.  Those familiar with vi should feel right at
home using CGDB.

   <p>The library responsible for communicating with GDB is called Trivial GDB
(tgdb, or more accurately, libtgdb).  This abstraction allows the UI code to
be independent of the debugger, as well as greatly simplifying its
implementation.

   <p>Those wanting to develop other interfaces to GDB are welcome to use libtgdb
as the basis for their program.  Many of the headaches of parsing GDB's output
and annotations can be avoided by using it.

   <p>Some features offered by CGDB are:

     <ul>
<li>Syntax-highlighted source window

     <li>Visual breakpoint setting

     <li>Keyboard shortcuts for common functions

     <li>Searching source window (using regexp)
</ul>
