<h2 class="chapter">9 Building CGDB from source</h2>

<p><a name="index-building-CGDB-35"></a>
Building CGDB from source requires several packages. First, CGDB is hosted
at http://sf.net/projects/cgdb. You can determine how to get CGDB from source
by looking here: http://sourceforge.net/svn/?group_id=72581.

   <p>Once you have the source to CGDB, now you can begin to build it.  You will of
course need many packages to build CGDB. Below is a list of all of them
that are required to build CGDB.

     <dl>
<dt><code>GNU Make</code><dd>I have successfully used version 3.79.1, however, older versions probably
will work.

     <br><dt><code>GNU GCC</code><dd>The GNU C compiler. I've compiled CGDB with versions as old as 2.9.5, and as
new as 4.0.2.

     <br><dt><code>GNU Readline</code><dd>The GNU readline library version 5.1. CGDB will not work with versions before
5.1.  Readline was modified specifically to work with CGDB.

     <br><dt><code>GNU Ncurses</code><dd>I have successfully used libncurses.so.5 successfully.  However, older versions
probably will work. 
</dl>

   <p>Below is a list of optional packages you will need, if modifying certain files
in CGDB.

     <dl>
<dt><code>GNU Flex</code><dd>If you modify any files with an extension of <code>.l</code>, you will have to have
flex installed.  I have used flex 2.5.4 to build CGDB.

     <br><dt><code>GNU Texinfo</code><dd>If you modify <samp><span class="file">doc/cgdb.texinfo</span></samp>, then you will be required to have this
package installed.  I have used version 4.7 to build the documentation for
CGDB.

     <br><dt><code>help2man</code><dd>If you are doing a release, then you will be required to have this package
installed.  In the <samp><span class="file">doc/</span></samp> build directory, you can execute the command
<code>make cgdb.1</code>, and the CGDB man page will be generated. 
</dl>

   <p>CGDB uses autoconf/automake to build its configure scripts and makefiles.  So,
if you change any of the autoconf/automake files, you will need this software
installed.

     <dl>
<dt><code>GNU Automake</code><dd>This has the program aclocal, and must be version Version 1.9.5.

     <br><dt><code>GNU Autoconf</code><dd>This has the program autoconf, and must be version 2.59.

     <br><dt><code>GNU m4</code><dd>This has the program m4, and must be version 1.4.3. 
</dl>
