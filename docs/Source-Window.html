<h3 class="section">2.1 Understanding the source window.</h3>

<p><a name="index-source-window-7"></a>
The <dfn>source window</dfn> is the window that provides you a view of the source
code that the debugged program is made up of.  It will display to the user a
single source file at a time.  While the user is debugging, via <code>next</code>
and <code>step</code>, CGDB will update the source file and line number to keep you
informed as to where GDB is debugging.

   <p>CGDB has several features that make debugging easier than using plain old GDB. 
One feature you will notice right away while debugging a C, C++ or ADA program,
is that the source files are syntax highlighted.  This allows the user to
easily navigate through the source file to look for certain places in the
source code.  If you would like to see another source language highlighted,
contact us.  To understanding how to navigate through the source window look
at the commands in <a href="CGDB-Mode.html#CGDB-Mode">CGDB Mode</a>.

   <p>In addition to showing the source code, CGDB also displays to the user the
currently executing line. The line number will be highlighted green, to
represent that the particular line, is the current line being debugged by GDB. 
Also, CGDB will display an arrow extending from the line number, to the
source line.  You can configure what type of arrow CGDB uses with the
<code>:set arrowstyle</code> configuration option. By default, the <code>short</code>
arrow is used.  However, my personal favorite is the <code>long</code> arrow.

   <p>As you navigate through the source window, the current line the cursor is
on will be highlighted white.  This simply helps you keep track of where you
are in the file.

   <p>Also, you can set or delete breakpoints in CGDB from the source window.  Simply
navigate to the line that you are interested in setting a breakpoint, and hit
the space bar.  This will set a breakpoint on the line if one did not already
exist.  The line number should turn red to indicate that a breakpoint has
been set.  Hitting the space bar again will delete the breakpoint.  If you
disable the breakpoint, the line number will turn yellow, to represent the
disabled breakpoint.

   <p><a name="index-regular-expression-search-8"></a>CGDB also supports regular expression searching within the source window.  If
you type <kbd>/</kbd> or <kbd>?</kbd> you can search in the source window for a string
of interest.  The C library regular expression functions are used to perform
this search, which honors things like &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>The full list of commands that are available in the source window is in
<a href="CGDB-Mode.html#CGDB-Mode">CGDB Mode</a>.
