<h2 class="chapter">4 CGDB configuration commands</h2>

<p><a name="index-configuring-CGDB-23"></a>
There may be several features that you find useful in CGDB.  CGDB is capable
of automating any of these commands through the use of the config file called
<samp><span class="file">cgdbrc</span></samp>.  It looks in <samp><span class="env">$HOME</span></samp><samp><span class="file">/.cgdb/</span></samp> for that file.  If it
exists, CGDB executes each line in the file in order.  It is as if the user
typed in all the commands into the status bar after the tui was initialized.

   <p>The following variables change the behavior of some aspect of CGDB.  Many
of these commands may be abbreviated in some way, and all boolean commands
my be negated by appending &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">no</span></samp>&rsquo; to the front.  For example:
<kbd>:set ignorecase</kbd> turns on case-insensitive searching; while
<kbd>:set noignorecase</kbd> turns on case-sensitive searching.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>:set as=</kbd><var>style</var><dt><kbd>:set arrowstyle=</kbd><var>style</var><dd>Set the arrow style to <var>style</var>.  Possible values for <var>style</var>
are &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">short</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">long</span></samp>&rsquo;, and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">highlight</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Changes the style of
the arrow that is used to indicate the currently executing line in the source
viewer.  The default value is short.  A longer arrow is available, for easier
readability.  Finally, the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">highlight</span></samp>&rsquo; option draws no arrow at all,
instead drawing the entire line in inverse video.

     <br><dt><kbd>:set asr</kbd><dt><kbd>:set autosourcereload</kbd><dd>If this is on, CGDB will automatically reload a source file if it has
changed since CGDB has opened it.  If it is off, the file will never be
reloaded, until you start CGDB again. The default is on. 
This feature is useful when you are debugging a program, then you modify
a source file, recompile, and type <kbd>r</kbd> in GDB's CLI window. The file in
this case will be updated to show the new version.  Note, CGDB only looks at
the timestamp of the source file to determine if it has changed. So if
you modify the source file, and didn't recompile yet, CGDB will still
pick up on the changes.

     <br><dt><kbd>:set cgdbmodekey=</kbd><var>key</var><dd>This option is used to determine what key puts CGDB into <dfn>CGDB Mode</dfn>. 
By default, the <kbd>ESC</kbd> key is used.  <var>key</var> can be any normal key
on the keyboard.  It can also be any keycode, as long as the keycode notation
is used.  This option is especially useful when the user wants to use
readline in vi mode.  If the user types <code>set cgdbmodekey=&lt;PageUp&gt;</code>
then the <kbd>Page Up</kbd> key will put CGDB into CGDB mode and the <kbd>ESC</kbd>
key will flow through to readline.

     <br><dt><kbd>:set ic</kbd><dt><kbd>:set ignorecase</kbd><dd>Sets searching case insensitive.  The default is off.

     <br><dt><kbd>:set stc</kbd><dt><kbd>:set showtgdbcommands</kbd><dd>If this is on, CGDB will show all of the commands that it sends to GDB. 
If it is off, CGDB will not show the commands that it gives to GDB. 
The default is off.

     <br><dt><kbd>:set syn=</kbd><var>style</var><dt><kbd>:set syntax=</kbd><var>style</var><dd>Sets the current highlighting mode of the current file to have the syntax
<var>style</var>.  Possible values for <var>syntax</var> are &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">c</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ada</span></samp>&rsquo;, and
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">off</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Normally, the user will never have to do this, since CGDB
automatically detects what syntax a file should be based on its file
extension.  However, this feature can currently be useful for debugging
purposes.

     <br><dt><kbd>:set to</kbd><dt><kbd>:set timeout</kbd><dd>This option is used along with the <var>ttimeout</var> option to determine the
behavior CGDB should have when it receives part of a mapped key sequence or
a keyboard code sequence.  If this option is on, CGDB will time out on both
user defined mappings and on key codes from the keyboard.  If this option
is off, user defined mappings will not be timed out on.  In this case, CGDB
will determine if it should time out on key codes from the keyboard by
examining the <var>ttimeout</var> option.  To determine how CGDB will time out
on mappings and key codes, and what time out lengths CGDB will use, please
refer to the chart in <a href="Key-User-Interface.html#Key-User-Interface">Key User Interface</a>.  The default value for this
option is on.

     <br><dt><kbd>:set tm=</kbd><var>delay</var><dt><kbd>:set timeoutlen=</kbd><var>delay</var><dd>This option is used along with the <var>ttimeoutlen</var> option.  It
represents the number of milliseconds that CGDB should wait for a key code
from the keyboard or for a mapped key sequence to complete.  If <var>delay</var> is
0, CGDB immediately accepts each character it receives.  This will prevent any
mappings or key codes to complete.  <var>delay</var> may be any value between
0 and 10000, inclusive.  The default setting for the <var>delay</var> variable is
1000 (one second).

     <br><dt><kbd>:set ttimeout</kbd><dd>This option is used along with the <var>timeout</var> option to determine the
behavior CGDB should have when it receives part of keyboard code sequence. 
If this option is on, CGDB will time out on key codes from the keyboard.  If
this option is off, CGDB will determine if it should time out on key codes
from the keyboard by examining the <var>timeout</var> option.  To determine how
CGDB will time out on key codes, what what time length it will use, please
refer to the chart in <a href="Key-User-Interface.html#Key-User-Interface">Key User Interface</a>.  The default value for this
option is on.

     <br><dt><kbd>:set ttm=</kbd><var>delay</var><dt><kbd>:set ttimeoutlen=</kbd><var>delay</var><dd>This option is used along with the <var>ttimeoutlen</var> option.  It
represents the number of milliseconds that CGDB should wait for a key code
from the keyboard.  If <var>delay</var> is 0, CGDB immediately accepts each character
it receives.  This will prevent any key codes to complete.  <var>delay</var> may
be any value between 0 and 10000, inclusive.  The default setting for the
<var>delay</var> variable is 100 (one tenth of a second).

     <br><dt><kbd>:set ts=</kbd><var>number</var><dt><kbd>:set tabstop=</kbd><var>number</var><dd>Sets the number of spaces that should be rendered on the screen for &lt;TAB&gt;
characters.  The default value for <var>number</var> is 8.

     <br><dt><kbd>:set wmh=</kbd><var>number</var><dt><kbd>:set winminheight=</kbd><var>number</var><dd>The minimal height of a window.  Windows will never become smaller than
this value.  The default value for <var>number</var> is 0.

     <br><dt><kbd>:set winsplit=</kbd><var>style</var><dd>Set the split point between source and GDB window.  This is especially useful
as an init setting in your <samp><span class="file">cgdbrc</span></samp> file.  See <a href="Configuring-CGDB.html#Configuring-CGDB">Configuring CGDB</a>.  The
possible values for <var>style</var> are &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">top_full</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">top_big</span></samp>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">even</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">bottom_big</span></samp>&rsquo;, and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">bottom_full</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <br><dt><kbd>:set ws</kbd><dt><kbd>:set wrapscan</kbd><dd>Searches wrap around the end of file.  The default is on.

     <br><dt><kbd>:c</kbd><dt><kbd>:continue</kbd><dd>Send a continue command to GDB.

     <dt><kbd>:down</kbd><dd>Send a down command to GDB.

     <br><dt><kbd>:e</kbd><dt><kbd>:edit</kbd><dd>reloads the file in the source window.  this can be useful if the file has
changed since it was opened by cgdb.

     <br><dt><kbd>:f</kbd><dt><kbd>:finish</kbd><dd>Send a finish command to GDB.

     <br><dt><kbd>:help</kbd><dd>This will display the current manual in text format, in the
<dfn>source window</dfn>.

     <br><dt><kbd>:hi </kbd><var>group</var><kbd> cterm=</kbd><var>attributes</var><kbd> ctermfg=</kbd><var>color</var><kbd> ctermbg=</kbd><var>color</var><kbd> term=</kbd><var>attributes</var><dt><kbd>:highlight </kbd><var>group</var><kbd> cterm=</kbd><var>attributes</var><kbd> ctermfg=</kbd><var>color</var><kbd> ctermbg=</kbd><var>color</var><kbd> term=</kbd><var>attributes</var><dd>Set the <var>color</var> and <var>attributes</var> for a highlighting group.  The syntax
mimics vim's &ldquo;highlight&rdquo; command.  Possible values for <var>group</var>,
<var>attributes</var> and <var>color</var> are available in <a href="Highlighting-Groups.html#Highlighting-Groups">Highlighting Groups</a>.

     <p>You can give as many or as few of the name=value pairs as you wish, in any
order.  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ctermfg</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ctermbg</span></samp>&rsquo; set the foreground and background
colors.  These can be specified by color number or by using the same color
names that vim uses.  When CGDB is linked with ncurses, the number you use to
represent the color can be between -1 and COLORS.  When CGDB is linked against
curses, it must be between 0 and COLORS.

     <p>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cterm</span></samp>&rsquo; sets the video attributes for color terminals.  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">term</span></samp>&rsquo; sets
the video attributes for monochrome terminals.  Some examples are,
     <pre class="smallexample">          :highlight Logo cterm=bold,underline ctermfg=Red ctermbg=Black
          :highlight Normal cterm=reverse ctermfg=White ctermbg=Black
          :hi Normal term=bold
</pre>
     <br><dt><kbd>:insert</kbd><dd>Move focus to the GDB window.

     <br><dt><kbd>:n</kbd><dt><kbd>:next</kbd><dd>Send a next command to GDB.

     <dt><kbd>:up</kbd><dd>Send an up command to GDB.

     <br><dt><kbd>:map </kbd><var>lhs</var> <var>rhs</var><dd>Create a new mapping or overwrite an existing mapping in CGDB mode. 
After the command is run, if <var>lhs</var> is typed, CGDB will get <var>rhs</var>
instead.  For more details on how to use the map command look in
<a href="Using-Maps.html#Using-Maps">Using Maps</a>. 
<br><dt><kbd>:unm </kbd><var>lhs</var><br><dt><kbd>:unmap </kbd><var>lhs</var><dd>Delete an existing mapping from CGDB mode.  <var>lhs</var> is what was typed
in the left hand side when the user created the mapping.  For example, if
the user typed <code>:map a&lt;Space&gt;b foo</code> then the user could delete the
existing mapping with <code>:unmap a&lt;Space&gt;b</code>. 
<br><dt><kbd>:im </kbd><var>lhs</var> <var>rhs</var><dt><kbd>:imap </kbd><var>lhs</var> <var>rhs</var><dd>Create a new mapping or overwrite an existing mapping in GDB mode. 
After the command is run, if <var>lhs</var> is typed, CGDB will get <var>rhs</var>
