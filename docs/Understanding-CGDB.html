<h2 class="chapter">2 Understanding the core concepts of CGDB</h2>

<p><a name="index-understanding-CGDB-2"></a>
<a name="index-status-bar-3"></a><a name="index-CGDB-mode-4"></a><a name="index-GDB-mode-5"></a><a name="index-TTY-mode-6"></a>The CGDB user interface currently consists of two windows and a status bar. 
The source window is currently on the top and the GDB window is on the
bottom.  The <dfn>status bar</dfn> currently separates the two windows.

   <p>The interface has several modes depending on which window is focused. 
<dfn>CGDB mode</dfn> is when the source window is focused, <dfn>GDB mode</dfn> is when
the GDB window is focused and <dfn>TTY mode</dfn> is when the TTY window is focused.

   <p>Beginning with CGDB version 1.0, the windows are movable,
and the user will be able to create as many or as few that is desired. 
Currently however, all of my time is spent developing the interface between
CGDB and GDB. Once this is complete, the UI of CGDB will become much more
polished.  If you are a ncurses developer, and have spare time to work on this
task, please contact me.
