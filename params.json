The interface is inspired by the classic\r\nUnix text editor, vi. Those familiar with vi (or vim) should feel\r\nright at home using cgdb. \r\n\r\n### Features\r\n\r\n* Syntax-highlighted source window\r\n* Visual breakpoint setting\r\n* Keyboard shortcuts for common functions\r\n* Searching source window (using regexp)\r\n* Scrollable gdb history of entire session\r\n* Tab completion\r\n* Key mappings (macros)\r\n\r\n### Installing\r\n\r\nNormally you can just install cgdb through your distribution's package\r\nmanager.  If you would like to build from the latest sources, you can:\r\n\r\n    $ git clone git://github.com/cgdb/cgdb.git\r\n    $ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local\r\n    $ make\r\n    $ sudo make install\r\n\r\ncgdb depends on a recent libreadline and ncurses.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\n\r\nFeel free to stop by our IRC channel `#cgdb` on freenode.\r\n"}
